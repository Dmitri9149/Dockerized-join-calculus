 1 The JoCaml language is used here for implementation of many parallel and distributed constructs. The     work is based on the tutorial : http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html

  3 The JoCaml is originated from join calculus. In some way the calculus is an alternative to lambda cal    culus. The JoCaml is implemented as an extension of OCaml. The JoCaml is very good for paralled and d    istributed multiagent computations. It is typed functional programming language.
  4 The expressive power of the language is quite high and the programm code is quite short.

  6 The best way to install JoCaml is from source tarball. Follow instructions on the http://jocaml.inria    .fr/

  8 In the future I plan to use the language and the constructs as semantics for molecular cell
  9 processes like intercellular interactions, virus - cell interaction, cell differentiation and prolife    ration.


### Dockerised environment for join calculus 

Join calculus and JOCaml language based on it are very suitable for some modelling parallel and distributed processes. See the description/tutorial/installation instructions for the language at : http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html

 The JoCaml installation (from tarball) on Ubuntu 16.04.0 is implemented as Dockerfile. So, it is possible to run a docker container and test simple programms on JoCaml within docker container.
