### Dockerised environment for join calculus 

Join calculus and JOCaml language based on it are very suitable for some modelling parallel and distributed processes. See the description/tutorial/installation instructions for the language at : http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html

 The JoCaml installation (from tarball) on Ubuntu 16.04.0 is implemented as Dockerfile. So, it is possible to run a docker container and test simple programms on JoCaml within docker container.
